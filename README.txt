==================================================================Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones DatasetVersion 1.0==================================================================Mario Amendola....@gmail.com==================================================================Description of the experiment and raw data used:=========================================================The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. - Its activity label. - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.The dataset includes the following files:=========================================- 'README.txt'- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.- 'features.txt': List of all features.- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. - 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. - 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. Description of the transformation and analysis performed on the raw data:=========================================================
How TidyData was generated:=========================================- We download the necessary raw data in the current directory and load them in the current R session - We use the features.txt to give proper descriptive variable column names to the Training set and the Test set dataframes- We add a variable subject ('subject_train.txt') and the variable activity ('train/y_train.txt') as variables (columns) to the Training set dataframe- We add a variable subject ('subject_test.txt') and the variable activity ('test/y_test.txt') as columns to the Testset dataframe- We joined the train and the test data in a single dataframe (DF) to have all the information together- From the combined dataframe we extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement together with the subject and the labels variables- We use the 'activity_labels.txt' to give descriptive names to the activity variable names- We gave better labels to the dataframe variable names - We use the described dataframe to create the TidyData dataframe, containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (the TidyData dataframe is described in the CodeBook.txt. file)- the TidyData dataframe was saved as tableThe dataset includes the following files:=========================================- 'README.txt'- 'TidyData.txt': a table that can be read in R with the following command:		  read.table(header=TRUE, sep='\t') - 'Codebook.txt': A file describing the TidyData. It contains an explanation of what the variables are and how they have been measured
- run_analysis.R: the R script that can be used to generate the TidyData
